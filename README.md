**7.css** is a CSS framework that takes semantic HTML and styles them to the Windows 7 design.
It is built on top of [XP.css](https://github.com/botoxparty/XP.css), which is an extension of [98.CSS](https://github.com/jdan/98.css).

It does not ship with any JavaScript, so it is compatible with your frontend framework of choice.

## üì¶ Usage

Make sure to put the 7.css file in the working directory of your site.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>7.css example</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/7.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="window active glass" style="margin: 32px; width: 250px">
        <div class="title-bar">
          <div class="title-bar-text">My First Program</div>
        </div>
        <div class="window-body">
          <p>Hello, world!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## üìö Documentation / Demo

Clone the repo and run `npm install`.

The core styles are managed in [`gui`](https://github.com/Unseeable8710/7.css/tree/main/gui).

You can use `npm start` to start a development environment that will watch for file changes and rebuild the files, reloading your browser in the process.

You can run a build manually with `npm run build`. This will write to the `dist/` directory.
